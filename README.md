The App is a personalized news aggregator that organizes and highlights whatâ€™s happening in the world so that you can discover more about the stories that matter to you. This App will show news headlines along with Covid Tracker.

In the Covid Tracker section Allows you to filter the Covid history data by US States.


App is written in Xcode 13.2.1 & Swift 5, followed MVVM, used async/await for API calls & Concurrent operations and NSCache for Image Caching which helps with better performances.

# Package Dependencies

# Charts library to render Covid data

The history of Covid cases can be seen graphically in the App, the trend charts are user friendly. The Charts library is used to represent Covid history data in the graphical manner.

# Note: Before compiling the code need to download package dependencies.

### CocoaPods

The CocoaPods implemented for adding SwiftLint tool. SwiftLint is an open-source tool to enforce Swift style and conventions.

The CocoaPods & Package Dependencies mechanism are used for adding third party libraries in this project. The purpose of using both mechanism is to showcase way of dependencies in the iOS App.

### Data Parsing / API Caller

The Generic function is implemented in the Service class which will work seamlessly to call APIs with async / await mechanism. However, in this project this function is commented out it is not being used because all the APIs are giving huge responses and we do not need all data, we need only selected data from the JSON response, a customized function is written to address this requirement.
